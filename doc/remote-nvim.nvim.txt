1. Remote Nvim - Remote development in Neovim*remote-nvim.nvim-remote-nvim---remote-development-in-neovim*

**remote-nvim.nvim** brings the Remote development using SSH
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh> in VSCode to Neovim. If you use
this plugin along with devpod <https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod>, this also
enables Dev Containers development natively from Neovim using this plugin.

Plugin has been tested to work on Linux and MacOS. WSL and Windows support is
planned (Author does not currently have access to Windows machine so
contributions are welcome).

**This plugin is still experimental. Breaking changes are expected (not a lot
though).**

      -- Configuration for SSH connections made using this plugin

      -- Binary with this name would be searched on your runtime path and would be
      -- used to run SSH commands. Rename this if your SSH binary is something else

        -- All your SSH config file paths.
        ssh_config_file_paths = { "$HOME/.ssh/config" },
        -- This helps the plugin to understand when the underlying binary expects
        -- input from user. This is useful for password-based authentication and
        -- key-based authentication.
        -- Explanation for each prompt:
        -- match - string - This would be matched with the SSH output to decide if
        -- SSH is waiting for input. This is a plain match (not a regex one)
        -- type - string - Takes two values "secret" or "plain". "secret" indicates
        -- that the value you would enter is a secret and should not be logged into
        -- your input history
        -- input_prompt - string - What is the input prompt that should be shown to
        -- user when this match happens
        -- value_type - string - Takes two values "static" and "dynamic". "static"
        -- means that the value can be cached for the same prompt for future commands
        -- (e.g. your password) so that you do not have to keep typing it again and
        -- again. This is retained in-memory and is not logged anywhere. When you
        -- close the editor, it is cleared from memory. "dynamic" is for something
        -- like MFA codes which change every time.

USAGE      *remote-nvim.nvim-remote-nvim---remote-development-in-neovim-usage*

Following user commands are available.


REMOTESTART ~

Used to setup/start session on a remote host. It can optionally take an input
as one of your earlier saved host configuration to make start faster. If ran
without an option, it launched a Telescope extension that guides you towards
creating a remote session.


REMOTESTOP ~

The plugin allows you to stop the remote server that was launched on a host.
Takes an argument from any of the running sessions.


REMOTELOG ~

See the plugin log file to see what the plugin is doing. It does not log much,
until you drop to the debug level. To start logging in debug level, start your
Neovim instance as `REMOTE_NVIM_LOG_LEVEL="debug" nvim`


REMOTESESSIONINFO ~

Provides you a view of all your currently running sessions. In case, you
decided not to start a client, the connection string that can be used to
connect to any of the running remote servers also shows up on this info box.


REMOTECLEANUP ~

If you decide that you want to clean up remote neovim from a host or are in a
situation where you need to start afresh, you can use this command. It takes as
an argument input the remote host that you want to cleanup. Once you cleanup,
it deletes the local saved configuration for the host, so next time, you can
start afresh.


REMOTECONFIGDEL ~

Sometimes, you are working on a remote instance and that remote instance is no
longer there. And you have this one config just left in there that keeps
nagging you. This takes any number of arguments where each argument is a saved
workspace configuration that you want to delete from your local. Think of this
as your Remote Neovim sweeping broom.


CAVEATS  *remote-nvim.nvim-remote-nvim---remote-development-in-neovim-caveats*

- Just because how Neovim server and client currently work, it is not possible
    to deterministically close a TUI so in case you do a `:q`, the server and the
    client both die. You can read the discussion here <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23093>
    to figure out your own way forward to just close a TUI or else just relaunch the
    session using `:RemoteStart`. It should be fast, after setup, if you are on a
    good network.
- When we launch the remote server, it is associated with the Neovim instance it
    is launched from. Closing that Neovim instance would close the server as well.
- This plugin does not introduce any changes in your PATH variables on remote
    server. Instead it runs with by modifying the `XDG_` variables when launching
    your remote Neovim instance so that your entire data is contained inside your
    remote neovim folder. So, take care when using any operations that depend on it.
- Sometimes, our Neovim configurations are buggy and when your client launches,
    you would see a fresh, clean Neovim installation (assuming you copied your
    Neovim config over). This is no fault with the plugin. Run `:messages` to see
    what went wrong. Usually, `git` or some other important binary is not available
    on the remote in some docker systems.
